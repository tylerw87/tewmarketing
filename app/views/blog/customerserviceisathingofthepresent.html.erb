			<p>Think, for a minute, about your daily interactions as a customer or client of others. When you see an attention-grabbing article title you decide to go to the site to check it out, but do you even bother to read the article if you can’t find it through the flurry of ads or do you just leave? What is your normal reaction when you see something on Amazon that you want to purchase but the seller has not quickly responded to your question? Have you ever seen a link to an item that you liked but after clicking on the link and being brought to the website you can’t seem to locate the actual item on the website? These are examples of missed customer service or customer experience opportunities.</p>
			<p>The focus for the past couple of decades has been so much on innovation that the important fundamental principles of successful businesses have fallen by the wayside. One that is often overlooked, unless we experience it of the terrible variety, is customer service.</p>
			<p>Would your customers feel close enough with you to do this?</p>
			<iframe width="630" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kD0QpaweYY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			<p>Today, let’s remember customer service, and focus on 5 key truths regarding not only a good customer experience, but a successful and growing business.</p>
			<p><h3>1. Word-of-Mouth Marketing is Still the Most Valuable Tool</h3></p>
			<p>This timeless truth has not changed. In fact, in our social media world, consider this your <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberlywhitler/2014/07/17/why-word-of-mouth-marketing-is-the-most-important-social-media/" target="_blank">number 1 platform</a>. This is Business 101, but don’t check it off the list just because you understand what it is. How are you recognizing this truth in your client interactions? Word-of-Mouth marketing has a positive connotation because it’s free. I hate to break it to you, but word-of-mouth marketing is NOT free. In order to generate a revenue from this channel, it will require outstanding customer service on your end. To achieve this, you need to be willing to give up some of your resources of time, energy, and sometimes money. For example, consider <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/10-customer-service-stories/" target="_blank">this story</a> of a bread company that received a letter from a child, took it seriously by returning a letter and a gift card to the child, and the letter then went viral online.</p>
			<p>Leverage this “free” tool by putting your resources to work, responding to customer inquiries, and seeking the truth from customers even if it might be negative. It does not take much to initiate solid word-of-mouth marketing, but you must engage your customers!</p>
			<p><h3>2. Former Customers are nearly Impossible to Re-acquire</h3></p>
			<p>This can be considered almost the opposite of truth number 1. Think of yourself as the customer again for a moment. When you are searching for something online and have clicked on multiple sites looking like they might have the answer you are looking for when in fact they did not, you avoid those purple-colored links signifying they were previously clicked on, right? What about a negative experience you had working with an IT company that your company hired to run tests on your servers? Are they your first call next time? Definitely not.</p>
			<p>Consider <a href="http://blog.clientheartbeat.com/why-customer-service-is-the-new-marketing/" target="_blank">this stat</a>: <i>“86% of consumers quit doing business with a company because of a bad customer experience.”</i> I hope this stat makes you rethink ignoring that client’s phone call or failing to deliver a service on time. I would take it one step farther. Do you want to master this? Consider every opportunity that you had to go above and beyond, when you failed to do so, a bad customer experience. You put so much work into your business, don’t think that one missed opportunity is okay.</p>
			<p><h3>3. Identify your Top Customers and Make Them Feel Special</h3></p>
			<p>You probably know who your top customers are without even thinking about it. Hopefully, you are learning from those people/companies how to reach more customers just like them, and ideally, you are also rewarding those individuals. Thanks to social media and blogging in the present day, we know that people enjoy sharing positive stories especially when it is about something against the norm.</p>
			<p>Giving your customers those feel good stories does not usually require much effort. Send a hand-written note or an email simply saying thank you. Discount their bill even slightly. Send them a gift card. These are simple, quick, and cheap ways to surprise your customers and make them feel incredible.</p>
			<p>Now, consider going the extra mile once in a while to WOW your customer. Have a customer appreciation day and party at your office. Are there any books that you have read that were inspirational to your business? Pass them along to your customers and include a note describing what this book meant to you. Perform these acts without having a “catch.” Take the time to focus solely on your top customers because they are your brand ambassadors, your word-of-mouth generators. <a href="http://www.helpscout.net/25-ways-to-thank-your-customers/" target="_blank">See a list</a> of these and other great customer thank-you ideas.</p>

			<p><h3>4. Make yourself Personally Available</h3></p>
			<p>I am sure that I’m not the only person who has been stuck trying to navigate through a 20 step automated voice messaging system in order to find assistance with a service that I’m paying for. Have you ever been on a website trying to find a company’s phone number to solve a matter quickly but the only contact available is filling out an online form. We are in a fast-paced world and we want answers quickly. Your clients will often feel the same way and desire a quick solution to their problem. </p>
			<p>Be purposeful in passing out your direct contact information. Don’t ever be too important to speak with your clients personally. They will know that it is rare and it will immensely enhance their experience with your business.</p>
			<p><h3>5. Cash in on your Customer Service Superiority</h3></p>
			<p>Your career should be fun, but it also needs to be financially savvy, right? This truth is geared more towards the fact that good customer service is financially worth it for you. Consider <a href="http://blog.clientheartbeat.com/why-customer-service-is-the-new-marketing/" target="_blank">this stat</a>, <i>“80% of U.S. consumers say they would pay more to ensure a superior customer experience.”</i> Now, we already know a couple of positives about good customer service: word-of-mouth marketing and loyalty. Add this truth to the mix as well, that customers will pay more to receive their goods or services from you based on the intangibles that you provide. </p>
			<p>Let this be your motivation. You don’t need to be a motivational leader or inspirational author to create a cultural change with your clients and customers. You need to get back to the basics of customer service. This service you need to provide to your customers is equally as important as the goods or services that you are selling to them. Good customer service is not a thing of the past. It is the trend of successful businesses today!</p>
