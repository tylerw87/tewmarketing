				<p class="articlequote">“Your personality has one primary Advantage. It’s how you add value… what makes you different and better. When you communicate using this Advantage, you earn more attention, and more revenue. This is not how you see the world but how the world sees you.”</p>
				<p class="quoteauthor">Sally Hogshead, howtofascinate.com</p>
				<hr>
				<p class="firstparagraph">Do you know what your personal strengths are? You probably have a good idea about whether or not you see yourself as a leader, or you are energetic per say. It’s important to know what you are good at so you can try to put yourself in a position where you will succeed. Think about a new perspective for a moment:</p>
				<p><h3>How would others describe me and my strengths?</h3></p>
				<p>Or better yet:</p>
				<p><h3>What is my number one unique personality advantage over others?</h3></p>
				<p>Recently, I came across an interview between Lewis Howes and Sally Hogshead on the podcast  “School of Greatness” where this very topic was discussed. Sally has found success in her life by captivating audiences with her unique personality strengths as the creator of an ad agency, author, and public speaker. Sally and her team’s in-depth research and testing has produced a great site, howtofascinate.com, and opportunity to learn about how anyone with any personality can leverage that uniqueness to gain a competitive advantage over others.</p>
				<p>I am pretty sure I have a good handle on what my strengths are. I think of myself as a leader who is creative and entrepreneurial and is always trying to find a better way to do something. While I believe those are my strengths, I also know that I have a lot more to learn to be most effective (honestly, as effective as you may be, you should always be striving to learn more if you are seeking success). So I decided it would be helpful to take Sally’s test and discover if people see me the way I see myself. My results:</p>
				<hr>
				<p>My Archetype label: The Maestro</p>
				<p>People see me as Ambitious, Focused, and Confident</p>
				<p>My primary advantage is Power. I express my ideas with conviction and act decisively. My secondary advantage is Prestige. I am driven by competition and am detail oriented. Language of excellence.</p>
				<p>How people see me at my best: I bring a competitive spirit and focus it on my goals. I am driven to raise the bar. I confidently focus on the end goal. I add value through knowledge, ambition, confidence. I make decisions easily, reach conclusions quickly, and take action to execute successfully.
				</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Remember, this is how the world sees me at my best. While I was glad to see that the results closely mirrored what I thought my strengths were, I was also challenged. Challenged because I know of many moments when I did not portray these characteristics. Moments when I was not at my best. Moments of failure. These were critical times, however, because I learned so much during these times of not following through and being the person I knew that I should be.</p>
				<p>This test above all gave me some clarity. Seeing that success isn’t going to come to me because I have a particular personality, but rather only when I am being that person. When I am being Ambitious, Focused, and Confident. I shouldn’t try to be anyone else because that is not where I am at my best. </p>
				<p>Whether I am marketing myself or marketing clients, the goal will always be to focus on the unique advantages. As a person, I challenge you to not be like everyone else. Embrace your unique personality and find success in all of your communications and relationships. As a business owner, I inspire you to find your personality strengths use them to focus the vision of your company. Only then will your company have uncapped potential.</p>
				<p>I recommend that you check out Sally’s site, <a href="howtofascinate.com">howtofascinate.com</a>, and take the next step toward realizing your potential!</p>
